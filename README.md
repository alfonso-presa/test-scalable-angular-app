test-scalable-angular-app
=========================

Sample scalable angular app with require.js. This is a WIP.

It's currently based in generator-angular with the adition of ui-router, require.js, and a little library that performs the injection of the angular app and it's controller by checking their dependencies from a JSON file. This way the integration of the components is done in a declarative way.
